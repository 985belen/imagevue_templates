# If you're running Apache web server you can use this file to improve the
# security of you Imagevue installation if you're using passwords
# just rename this file to: 
#
# .htaccess (no extension)
#
# This will prevent access to xml files which can be used to fish out the paths to images
#
# It might be a good idea to put the resulting .htaccess in the content/ folder
# Then it won't block all .xml files on the site if you need it.
